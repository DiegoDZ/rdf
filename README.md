#Radial distribution function g(r) 

Python script to compute the radial distribution function for a mixture of two types of particles. 

__rdf_xy.py__ computes g(r) for particles of type x and particles of type y.


__rdf_xx.py__ computes g(r) for particles of type x. 

In the folder **example** there is a real example using LAMMPS.
